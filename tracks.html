                        <br />
                        The Kepler Track is a 60 km, 3-4 day looptrack taking you from the gentle, beech-forested shores of lakes Te Anau and Manapouri to the tussocky alpine tops and grand Mt Luxmore. Your reward for the hill climb is a long section above bushline with marvellous panoramic views of the Kepler Mountains on one side, and lakes, rivers and hanging valleys on the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Kepler Track is an excellent track for you and your family and friends, especially if you love the outdoors, want an adventure with a bit of a physical challenge that is not too hard to get to and has excellent facilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a Great Walk and offers a high standard of track and very comfortable, serviced huts as well as camping opportunities. During the winter months (May to October) the Kepler Track remains open, but with reduced facilities and additional safety risks to consider.
                    </p>

                        During the winter season (May to October) the Kepler Track remains open, but with reduced facilities. Tramping is possible and beautiful, however only for parties who are well equipped and experienced at tramping and route finding in winter conditions with avalanche risk. Make sure you are fully prepared before you go.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You'll be awed by natural wonders while walking in a spectacular, wild and beautiful part of New Zealand. There are sheer ice-carved valleys from a mountain pass, refreshing mountain rivers, peaceful forests and cascading waterfalls.
                    </p>

                        Experience a walk of a lifetime on the Routeburn Track - a 32 km, 2-4 day track weaving through beech-forested valleys and alongside clear green rivers, glistening alpine lakes and breathtaking views from a mountain pass.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feel close to nature as you cross New Zealand’s Southern Alps and pass through the incredible landscapes of Mt Aspiring National Park and Fiordland National Park.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Routeburn Track is the perfect track for you, and your friends or family, if you love being amongst nature and want an exciting outdoors adventure on a track that has excellent facilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <b>Activities on the Routeburn Track</b>
                    <br />
                    There are many activities you can enjoy on the Routeburn Track as well as day walking or tramping. These include, guided walks, guided canyoning, hunting (access only) and the Routeburn Classic mountain run.
                    <p>
                    Walking in the outdoors is a fun, healthly activity for the whole family. Although the alpine sections of the Routeburn Track are not recommended for children a great overnight alternative is to walk in and stay at either Lake Howden Hut or Routeburn Flats Hut.
